<h1>JSF 2.0: Blank Starting-Point Project</h1>
<p>
<b>This is Page A.</b> You should access this page as "page-a.jsf",
not as "page-a.xhtml". If the following looks like an input form, and pressing
the button navigates to Page B, it shows that you have
correctly installed JSF 2.0. Use this project as the starting point
for your own JSF 2.0 projects, as described in the tutorial.
</p>
<fieldset>
<legend>JSF Test Form</legend>
<h:form>
  Some random data: <h:inputText/><br/>  <!-- Textfield ignored -->
  Some other data: <h:inputText/><br/>   <!-- Textfield ignored -->
  <h:commandButton value="Go to Page B" 
                   action="page-b"/>     <!-- Navigates to page-b.jsf -->
</h:form>
</fieldset>
<p>
If the tags like h:form and h:commandButton are totally ignored, it probably
means that you don't have jsf-api.jar and jsf-impl.jar in WEB-INF/lib, or that
you haven't mapped the FacesServlet in web.xml. If you get a JSF-specific error message,
it probably means that you used the wrong URL (i.e, ending in page-a.xhtml instead of 
page-a.jsf).
